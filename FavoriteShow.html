		<h1>Why is American Dad my favorite show?</h1>

		<img src = "imgs/american.jpg">
		
        <p> Shows like American Dad have been in my life for a while. As bad as it may sound i've watched them since I was little <br>
        There is something just so releaving about not having to find a show that you have to commit too. <br>
        You can start at any episode and be ready relax and binge for a while. You dont have to think about the plot line because there isn't one. </p>
