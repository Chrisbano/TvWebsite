        <p> In American Dad the most important and funny characters are Roger, Steve and Stan. <br> Roger
            is just super funny and adds alot of humor the show. Steve is funny in a feel bad for him type of way <br>
            because nothing goes his way. And Stan is just so crazy and sporadic which really adds alot to the show.
